# BreadBooster

Have you ever found yourself living in a 1950's-era house with unbalanced non-adjustable hot water radiators? What? You haven't? Well, too bad! BreadBooster is a device which blows air through your radiator when it detects that the radiator is warm. This allows the heat to dissipate faster than by convection alone.
